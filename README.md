# MediaShare (Node.js Media Sharing App)

## About the Application
I have developed a simple media sharing application using Node.js. I designed this application for use within my local network and solely for personal usage. 
I do not recommend deploying this application on external servers as it is not intended for such use and poses significant security risks for server environments. However, it can be utilized for basic media sharing within your local network.
## How to Use the Application
As the application is Node.js-based, you can start it by running the command "node server.js" or "npm start". You can access the application via the IP address and port being listened to on your local network.
Through the application, you can directly upload videos, images, music, or any other content from your devices. Alternatively, you can place any desired files or folders into the "public/media" directory within the application's file structure.
While the server is running, you can view the uploaded files directly through the browser, especially videos, images, and music.
